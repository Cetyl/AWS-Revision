# VPC Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) suitable for production environments, focusing on high availability, security, and scalability. By utilizing AWS services, we deploy servers in two Availability Zones (AZs), leveraging an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

## Project Components
- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: The main networking environment where all components reside.
- **Subnets**: Logical partitions within the VPC that can be public or private.
- **NAT Gateway**: Enables instances in private subnets to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing inbound traffic from the internet.
- **EC2 Instances**: The servers running your application, deployed in private subnets for security.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, enhancing availability and reliability.
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic demands, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
- **Bastion Host**: A secure server used to access instances in private subnets.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Creating the VPC
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the VPC Dashboard.
3. Create a new VPC:
   - **CIDR Block**: `10.0.0.0/16` (provides a large address space for subnets)
   - **Name**: `ProductionVPC`
   - **Tenancy**: Default (use default instance tenancy)

### 2. Subnets Configuration
**Create Public Subnets:**
- **First Public Subnet**:
  - **CIDR Block**: `10.0.1.0/24`
  - **Availability Zone**: `us-east-1a`
  - **Name**: `PublicSubnetA`
- **Second Public Subnet**:
  - **CIDR Block**: `10.0.3.0/24`
  - **Availability Zone**: `us-east-1b`
  - **Name**: `PublicSubnetB`

**Create Private Subnets:**
- **First Private Subnet**:
  - **CIDR Block**: `10.0.2.0/24`
  - **Availability Zone**: `us-east-1a`
  - **Name**: `PrivateSubnetA`
- **Second Private Subnet**:
  - **CIDR Block**: `10.0.4.0/24`
  - **Availability Zone**: `us-east-1b`
  - **Name**: `PrivateSubnetB`

### 3. NAT Gateway Setup
1. **Create an Elastic IP**:
   - Navigate to Elastic IPs in the EC2 dashboard.
   - Allocate a new Elastic IP address.

2. **Create a NAT Gateway**:
   - Go to NAT Gateways in the VPC dashboard.
   - Click on Create NAT Gateway.
   - Select a Public Subnet (either PublicSubnetA or PublicSubnetB).
   - Associate the Elastic IP you just created.

3. **Update Route Table of Private Subnets**:
   - Navigate to Route Tables in the VPC dashboard.
   - Select the route table associated with PrivateSubnetA and PrivateSubnetB.
   - Add a route:
     - **Destination**: `0.0.0.0/0`
     - **Target**: NAT Gateway

### 4. Launching EC2 Instances
1. **Create an EC2 Launch Template**:
   - Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Click on Launch Templates and create a new one.
   - **Instance Type**: `t2.micro` (or other based on your requirements).
   - **AMI**: Select a suitable Amazon Machine Image (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).
   - **Key Pair**: Select or create a new key pair for SSH access.
   - **Security Group**: Create a new security group to allow inbound traffic for HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22).

2. **Launch EC2 Instances**:
   - Use the launch template to deploy instances in PrivateSubnetA and PrivateSubnetB.

### 5. Configuring the Load Balancer
1. **Create an Application Load Balancer**:
   - Navigate to Load Balancers in the EC2 dashboard.
   - Click on Create Load Balancer and select Application Load Balancer.
   - **Scheme**: internet-facing.
   - **VPC**: Select ProductionVPC.
   - **Subnets**: Select both PublicSubnetA and PublicSubnetB.

2. **Configure Listeners**:
   - **Listener**: HTTP on port 80.
   - **Default Action**: Forward to a new target group.

3. **Create Target Group**:
   - **Target Type**: Instance.
   - **Health Check Protocol**: HTTP.
   - **Health Check Path**: `/` (or your application path).

4. **Register Targets**:
   - Add your EC2 instances to the target group.

### 6. Auto Scaling Group
1. **Create an Auto Scaling Group using the Launch Template**:
   - Navigate to the Auto Scaling Groups section.
   - Click on Create Auto Scaling group.
   - Use the launch template created earlier.
   - **VPC**: Select ProductionVPC.
   - **Subnets**: Select PrivateSubnetA and PrivateSubnetB.

2. **Configure Scaling Policies**:
   - Set **Minimum Size**: 2.
   - Set **Desired Capacity**: 2.
   - Set **Maximum Size**: 5.
   - Create scaling policies based on CPU utilization or request count to maintain application performance.

3. **Attach the Auto Scaling Group to the Load Balancer**.

### 7. Bastion Host Integration
A **Bastion Host** (or jump server) is a special-purpose instance that acts as a gateway between the public internet and your private instances. Here’s how to set it up:

1. **Launch a Bastion Host**:
   - Create an EC2 instance in one of the public subnets (PublicSubnetA or PublicSubnetB).
   - Use a security group that allows inbound SSH access (port 22) from your trusted IP address.

2. **Access Private Instances**:
   - Connect to the Bastion Host via SSH using your key pair.
   - From the Bastion Host, you can SSH into private instances using their private IP addresses:
     ```bash
     ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@private-ip-address
     ```
3. **Copy the Keyfile.pem from local to Bastion Host**:
   ```bash
      scp -i ./keypair-new.pem  ./keypair-new.pem ubuntu@54.12.84.90:/home/ubuntu
     ```    

4. **Security Group Considerations**:
   - The security group for private EC2 instances should allow inbound SSH traffic only from the Bastion Host’s private IP address.

## Security Considerations
- **Security Groups**: Configure security groups to restrict traffic. Allow only necessary inbound and outbound rules.
  - **EC2 Security Group**: Allow HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) only from trusted IPs.
  - **Load Balancer Security Group**: Allow HTTP (port 80) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) and restrict access to the EC2 instances.
- **Network ACLs**: Use Network ACLs to add an additional layer of security by controlling traffic to and from your subnets.
- **IAM Roles**: Assign least privilege IAM roles to EC2 instances to allow only necessary permissions for AWS resources.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you have successfully created a resilient and secure VPC architecture in AWS, complete with EC2 instances deployed across multiple Availability Zones, managed by an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer. The addition of a Bastion Host enhances security by providing controlled access to private resources.
